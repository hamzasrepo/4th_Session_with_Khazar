You are tasked with creating a custom method for splitting a 
dataset into smaller parts, similar to k-fold cross-validation, 
but designed for a simple list of numbers.

Input:

A list of integers, e.g., [1, 2, 3, ..., 100]
The number of folds, k (e.g., k = 5).

Task:

Divide the list into k equal parts (or as equal as possible if 
the list size isnâ€™t perfectly divisible by k).

For each fold:

Treat one part as the "validation set."
Treat the remaining parts combined as the "training set."
Print the "training set" and "validation set" for each fold.

Sample Output:

Fold 1:
Training Set: [21, 22, ..., 100]
Validation Set: [1, 2, ..., 20]

Fold 2:
Training Set: [1, 2, ..., 20, 41, ..., 100]
Validation Set: [21, 22, ..., 40]

Fold 5:
Training Set: [1, 2, ..., 80]
Validation Set: [81, 82, ..., 100]
